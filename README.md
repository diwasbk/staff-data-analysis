# Staff Data Analysis Project

This project performs various SQL queries and data analysis tasks on the `staff` dataset. The dataset is stored in a CSV file named `staff.csv`.

## Description

The project demonstrates SQL queries for data retrieval, aggregation, and analysis using the `staff` dataset. It includes queries for basic data retrieval (`SELECT`), filtering (`WHERE`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), aggregation functions (`AVG`, `SUM`, `COUNT`), joins (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`), and conditional logic (`CASE` statements).

## Files Included

- `staff.csv`: CSV file containing the staff data.
- `staff-data-analysis.sql`: SQL queries used for data analysis.

## SQL Queries

The project includes various SQL queries to analyze the `staff` data:

- Retrieve all records, select specific columns, filter by conditions.
- Perform aggregation functions (average salary, total expense).
- Use joins to combine `staff` data with `department` data.
- Conditional statements to categorize salary levels.

## Usage

To use this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Load `staff.csv` into your SQL database or use it directly.
3. Execute `staff-data-analysis.sql` in your SQL environment to perform data analysis tasks.
